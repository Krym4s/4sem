## Task 1 

The purpose of this task was to create array of dinamically changing length for any types with it's own iterstor or foreach function. This structure has pretty common interface.

## Task 2

This task was created to make a research in how pocessor's cores work. The purpose is to make a linear corelation between number of threads and number of cores now working. To make it possible we launch pseudothreads to burn cores in case they will not be ready to work at full power. This programm counts thee value of integral. Each thread gets segment, the length of which depends on the number of threads. Cores that are not used gets segment equal to the one of working cores.
